# To_Solve_Ordinary_Differential_Equation_using_Runge_Kutta_Method
1. Wrote a MATLAB script to solve ODE using Runge-Kutta method of order 2 (Euler-Cauchy Method or Heun Method).
2. The Runge-Kutta method finds an approximate value of y for a given value of x. Only first-order ordinary differential equations can be solved by using the Runge-Kutta 2nd order method.
